#guess number is just a simple game i made out of boardom, and anyone else can also work on the game and give me  feed back about the game code, and if there is any bug just let me
know by chatting me up via LinkedIn(check my github profile to get my linkedin user link).
#how to play this game.
#for you to play this game all you just need to do is to guess any number between 1 to 5, i made it 1 - 5 so it can be alot more easier to play.
#and i also have more games to come.
